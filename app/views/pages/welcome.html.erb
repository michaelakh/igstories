      What is instagram?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Instagram is a free photo and video sharing app available on Apple iOS, Android and Windows Phone. People can upload photos or videos to our service and share them with their followers or with a select group of friends. They can also view, comment and like posts shared by their friends on Instagram.

      What are instagram stories?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Instagram stories is a feature on Instagram that allows users to post photos or videos that vanish after 24 hours. When a user shares a story, it is ephemeral meaning it can’t be viewed once 24 hours have elapsed. If you’re trying to download an Instagram story that one of your friends or favorite celebrity has posted there is no way to do it on Instagram.
